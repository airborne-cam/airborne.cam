This app helps users understand how mitigation measures affect the indoors transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The estimated risk percentage should be treated with great caution! Many of the model inputs are very uncertain. Thus, the user should see how risk of infection decreases or increases by using face masks, by improving ventilation, etc. It is assumed that hands are washed and that individuals are far apart from each other â€” that is, the risk of short-range transmission by droplets/aerosol is not included and might be significant.

The indicated risk depends on a number of assumptions and the uncertainties in the background science are too high for an absolute quantification of risk. The tool is available for use without any guarantees of the results it outputs. The use of Airborne.cam is the sole responsibility of the user. The authors accept no legal responsibility for the accuracy or misuse of the numbers and results output by this tool.

In an effort to keep this app relevant to address the COVID-19 pandemic, the calculation method will be constantly updated to keep up with the latest scientific findings.
